# Agricore Short Term Model

This repository contains the code for the AGRICORE short term model, which provides a financial optimisation of a set of agents behaviour regarding investments. It also includes a land market module (which can be enabled or disabled) to perform an auction-based set of transactions between the simulated agents, based on the desires of each agent on purchasing / selling land.
